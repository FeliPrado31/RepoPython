# RepoPython
This is an MVP CRUD in Python. You add customers, products and create invoices.

### More infomation
The project has a linked database for testing, so if you're using the live demo, or cloning it without changing it might be a bit slow.

### Install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/FeliPrado31/RepoPython.git
cd RepoPython
pip install -r requeriments.txt
```

### Live demo!


### Tested on

Python version - 3.8.3

# Warning

If you change port 8080, you will have to change some fetches that point to that port in the routes.
Be careful.
